# Next.js 15 Client-Side Component Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where errors related to missing client-side components are not handled gracefully.  The application crashes when a component that is only present on the client-side is accessed.

## Bug Description

The `about.js` file contains a component that might not always exist on the client-side. When the application attempts to render it without proper error handling it crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust error handling using try-catch blocks, conditional rendering or other appropriate techniques to check the existence of the client-side component before rendering it. This prevents the application from crashing.
